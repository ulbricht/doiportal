# doiportal
AJAX-SOLR frontend to the DOIDB

#Installation
clone https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw into the root directory  
clone https://github.com/evolvingweb/ajax-solr into the root directory

#remarks
Since it is not recommended to expose SOLR installations to the public, you will need a proxy software to access your SOLR collection. A proxy implementation for PHP could be http://github.com/PTCInc/solr-php-client .
